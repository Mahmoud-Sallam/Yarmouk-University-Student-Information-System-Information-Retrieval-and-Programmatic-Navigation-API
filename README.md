# Yarmouk University Student Information System Information Retrieval and Programmatic Navigation API Contribution using JAVA
The API is demonstrated as a Java class called Connect, it provides convenient mechanisms to perform the services that are provided by the SIS (Student Information System) website programmatically.

This is a convenient API that enables developers to access Yarmouk University's students' data without having direct access to their database servers. Instead, it shoots out HTTP requests and receives responses to grab HTML documents using 'jsoup'. It then processes these HTML documents and extracts data out of them to eventually store them dynamically in a proper data structure and finally return them to the developer. 

This API is also able to perform programmatic logins, credential validation, button clicking, web navigation, and changing users' passwords.
